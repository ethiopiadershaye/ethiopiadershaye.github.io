								<p>I am an Australian born Ethiopian who has lived in Melbourne my entire life. I speak both English and Amharic (the national language of Ethiopia) and a small amount of Indonesian after having learnt it for 5 years primary and secondary school. In my spare time I like to read, watch movies and play Volleyball.</p>

							<article id="interest">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>My interest in Information Technology (IT) progressed as I noticed its growing importance over the years. It became clear that IT is implemented in almost all careers and so by studying IT, I would be able to increase my skills in the tech field as well as increase my job opportunities in the future. Although I have no IT experience yet, I am excited to be apart of innovating new ideas that will help others with their everyday lives.<p/>
								<p>I was already studying at RMIT for my Bachelors in Applied Science (Psychology) because it seemed like the best place for psychology for me that wasn’t too hard to get to and that would accept me with the ATAR that I had. I then realised that I was able to pick an elective and as I was already interested in IT and wanted to see how I liked it, decided to choose it.<p/>
								<p>I’m currently studying Applied Science (Psychology) with Introduction to IT as an elective. In psychology I am eager to learn and understand why people, including myself, are the way that they are and what motivates and influences individuals to act in certain ways. Although I have only just started studying Introduction to IT as an elective, and I am mostly interested in web and app development, I hope to learn the basic fundamental skills essential for work in the IT field. <p/>

							<article id="job">
								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I found a <a href="https://au.indeed.com/jobs?q=Mobile%20Application%20Developer&vjk=0015aa4fca977bfe">job online</a> his job is a full time position working as a Mobile App Developer at a start up company Sellcrowd. What makes this position appealing to me is the potential to work at a start up company where my skills and expertise will be highly valued.<p/>
								<p>In order to be considered for this opportunity, I must have a variety of skills including coding and Swift/ Objective C capabilities, ability to use Firebase or AWS and cloud database, APIs like Google Places and also be able to quickly acquire the expertise of newly developing technology. Although I have never dealt with any app developing software and have little to no skills and experience in the IT field, taking a course in intro to IT is the first step towards my ideal job as it allows to me to learn the basics of the IT world. As I have only recently decided that I would like to pursue a career in IT, I am yet to transfer from my current Psychology course into a Bachelor of IT, which I believe, will further increase my IT knowledge and expertise and assist me with excelling in future years. I will also take on both volunteer and paid work to further develop necessary skills like coding, React Native and Flutter.io use as an app developer.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="consul personality type" /></span>
								<p>These results mean that I am an extraverted, sensing, feeling, judging and turbulent person who enjoys getting together with friends, cares about the feelings of others, and prefers to be rather organised. This personality type may influence my behaviour in a team as I may take charge and assign individuals different tasks that should be completed, as I like for things to have structure. I also may be inflexible with new or different ideas that my teammates have which may cause conflict during the group. Therefore when forming a team, I will take extra care in listening to what others would like to do and try to understand and take into consideration their views.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="learning style" /></span>
								<p>These results mean that I prefer to learn by both listening and actively doing what is being taught. This learning style may influence how I act in a team as all individuals in the team may have distinct learning styles and thus, prefer to learn in different ways. Therefore to overcome this obstacle we should make sure to include different learning styles in our discussions and while brainstorming. We should also understand if people do not fully understand our ideas because they are a visual or tactile learner and provide ways for them to understand the ideas such as drawing it or showing them similar concepts.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="big5" /></span>
								<p>The results of this Big Five Personality Test mean that I am not very emotionally stable and have low imagination, however I am very agreeable and conscientious. In a team environment, this may impact my role, as I may not have as many ideas as the rest of the team. Also with as I am not very emotionally stable, I may feel upset if others reject my ideas in the group. When forming a team I therefore may have to try harder to come up with new concepts to assist with the group, and also not take the rejection of my proposals personal and understand that others may have more interesting ideas.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<p>This will be an app compatible with both android and iOS, which acts primarily as a directory app for shopping centres such as Highpoint, Melbourne Central, Emporium Melbourne and Chadstone. It will be fitted with shops such as Factorie, Adidas and Target as well as the different restaurants available in the food court including places like McDonald’s, Dumplings Plus and Max Brenner. <p/>
								<p>According to <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-largest-shopping-centres-in-australia.html">worldatlas.com,</a> of the largest shopping centres in Australia, Victoria is leading with Chadstone Shopping Centre as number 1. Victoria also home to 4 of the top 10 biggest shopping centres with New South Wales and Queensland close behind at 3 each. Chadstone Shopping Centre is 190,000 square metres, which means that it’s almost the size of 11 MCG’s! Remembering where each and every store is located and the way to get there can be challenging, especially if you aren’t regularly going shopping in the same shopping centres. Therefore, an app that gets you to your favourite shops is long overdue. <p/>
								<p>The apps main feature will be its ability to direct users to and from their favourite stores. Individuals will be able to choose from categories such as clothing, accessories, shoes and cafes and restaurants or simply search their desired store from a list of all available stores. Once individuals have selected a store, they will be directed with step-by-step instructions on how to get there. Users will also have the ability to create a sequence of stores, which the app will scan and find the closest store to the individual. The app will then make its way down the list in order of store proximity. Individuals will also be able to search for the nearest toilets based on their location. Additionally included will be a deals and discounts page where you can see store offers before getting to the store to assist in deciding whether or not you would like to shop there. In addition to these features, a Favourites tab will also be implemented to save time searching for stores, where individuals will be able to favourite stores they frequently visit to add to their list of stores they would like to visit. 
Another feature of the app will be the ability to find where there are empty parking spaces to spend less time finding car parking and more time shopping. After the app user has found a parking space, they will be able to drop a pin where the car was parked to assist in easier access to it, once they have completed their shop. The app will store where the car was parked and when the individual is ready to leave, give directions from their current location, straight to their car using the exit closest to where their car was parked. They will also be able to have the option to set a timer if the parking space has a time limit. A reminder will be given in the last 15 mins and again in the last 5 mins remaining.<p/>
								<p>
								<p>
								<p>If this project were successful, it would become extremely helpful and essential to the shopping experience, putting more time back into shopping. This app makes going shopping more convenient by eliminating those factors that steer us away from shopping at particular places, such as not finding parking. Also, rather than getting lost and looking for directory maps or information desks around the shopping centre, or remembering where you parked your car hours and hours ago, you can focus on what you went there to do, shop.<p/>
